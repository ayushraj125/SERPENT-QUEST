Welcome to Serpent Quest! This Snake Game leverages the principles of Data Structures, Algorithms, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to deliver a simple yet engaging gaming experience. In this game, you control a snake that moves towards food using keyboard keys. Each time the snake consumes a piece of food, it grows by one unit, and your score increases by one. The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the boundary of the screen.

Project Overview
Developing Serpent Quest was an excellent opportunity to apply my knowledge of arrays and OOP. I implemented the snake's movement and growth using data structures efficiently, and structured the game logic with clean, modular OOP principles.

Key Features:
Dynamic Snake Movement: The snake moves in response to keyboard inputs.
Growth Mechanism: Each piece of food consumed increases the snake's length and the player's score.
Game Termination: Collision with the snake's body or the screen boundary ends the game.

IDE: CODEBLOCKS
Language: C++
Libraries: Standard Template Library (STL) for data structures

Learning Highlights:
Data Structures: Efficiently used arrays to manage the snake's body and food positioning.
Algorithms: Implemented game logic to handle snake movement, collision detection, and score tracking.
OOP Principles: Designed a modular and clean codebase following OOP best practices.

How to Run the Game:
Copy code
Open the project in CODEBLOCKS.
Build and run the project.


This project was not just a coding exercise but a comprehensive learning journey. It helped me solidify my understanding of fundamental programming concepts and discover new techniques and best practices in game development.

Feeling proud and accomplished! ðŸ’ª
